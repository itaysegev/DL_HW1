part2_q1 = r"""
**Your answer:**

Increasing the value of k in the KNN algorithm can lead to improved generalization for unseen data up to a certain point,
beyond which the performance may start to degrade.
When k is very small, the model may overfit to the training data and fail to capture the underlying patterns in the data,
resulting in poor generalization to new data.
On the other hand, when k is very large, the model may oversimplify the decision boundary and treat distant points as equally important as nearby points,
which can also lead to poor generalization.
In general, the optimal value of k depends on the complexity of the underlying data distribution,
the noise level in the data, and the size of the training set.
In practice, a common approach is to perform cross-validation to tune the hyperparameter k and choose the value that gives the best performance on a validation set.

**Your answer:**
The main advantage of k-fold CV is that it provides a more reliable estimate of the generalization performance of
the model by simulating the process of training and testing on multiple independent subsets of the data
By using k-fold CV, we can obtain a more accurate and unbiased estimate of the true performance of the model,
as it accounts for the variability and randomness in the data and reduces the risk of overfitting to the train-set.
In contrast, training on the entire train-set with various models and selecting the best model based on train-set accuracy can lead to overfitting to the train-set,
as the model may learn the idiosyncrasies and noise in the train-set that do not generalize well to new data.
Moreover, k-fold CV allows us to evaluate and compare the performance of different models or hyperparameters in a fair and systematic way, as all models are trained and tested on the same data subsets.
This can help us select the best model or hyperparameters that optimize the performance on the unseen data.
The main disadvantage of selecting the best model based on test-set accuracy is that it introduces bias in the model selection process,
as the test set is no longer independent from the training process. By using the test set to select the best model,
we are indirectly optimizing the model to perform well on the test set, which may not generalize well to new data.
K-fold CV allows us to evaluate the performance of the model on multiple independent subsets of the data and obtain a more reliable estimate of the true performance. By using k-fold CV, we are simulating the process of training and testing on multiple independent train-test splits and averaging the performance across them. This can reduce the variability and randomness in the data and provide a more accurate estimate of the generalization performance of the model.
Furthermore, k-fold CV allows us to use all the available data for training and evaluation, without sacrificing the effective sample size for model selection. This can lead to a more robust and generalizable model, as it is trained on more data and has learned the underlying patterns that are more likely to generalize to new data.
